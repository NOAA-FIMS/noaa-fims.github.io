FIMS has both reoccurring meetings, e.g., FIMS Code Club and FIMS Implementation Team Meeting, and one-off meetings each month. See the calendar below for meeting descriptions and links to running notes for each meeting. Additionally, if the meeting is public, there will be a hyperlink in the description containing the google meet link so you can join in on the fun. Feel free to let us know (see the [contact page](../contact/index.qmd)) if there are meetings that you are interested in joining but links are not provided; unless it is an Implementation Team Meeting, which is currently limited to [Implementation Team Members](../contact/contributors.qmd#core-developers) only.
