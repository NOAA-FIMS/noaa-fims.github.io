# Mission

The mission of the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) is to **enhance the connection of models used to assess the status of managed fish stocks to ecosystem, climate, and socioeconomic factors while meeting current management needs.**

We aim to accomplish our mission with a **user-friendly stock assessment tool** that **streamlines** the development and application of scientific advice to inform current and future management needs of NOAA Fisheries' regions.

# Community

A team of [experts](contributors.qmd) within NOAA Fisheries is designing and developing the system, and we are advised by the [FIMS Council](contributors.qmd#fims-council) which includes academic, industry, and international partners.

Contributions from individuals of all skill levels are welcome. The codebase and documentation heavily relies of contributions from volunteers and it is imperative that we receive both feedback and contributions from users to ensure the user experience remains true to our aim of being user friendly. The roles of internal and external collaborators are outlined in the [roles section](contributors.qmd#roles) of this community playbook. 

## Get involved <i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i>

Users and developers are welcome to join the [Discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/discussions) or submit bug reports using GitHub Issues. Please use the issues under [collaborative workflow](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/collaborative_workflow/issues) to make suggestions about the developer guide and the issues under the FIMS software [repository](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/issues) for software design and development feedback.

# Background

The idea for FIMS came out of the 2019 [CAPAM workshop](https://capamresearch.org/Next-Gen-SAM) on the creation of frameworks for the next generation general stock assessment models. Around the same time, a project led by Bai Li demonstrated that [similar results were possible using 4 different assessment models used in the United States](https://doi.org/10.7755/FB.119.2-3.5). The pandemic also increased our ability to work online and collaborate across NOAA Fisheries regions, so stock assessment scientists at NOAA Fisheries became more familiar with work being done in other regions. All of these forces led to the realization that a unified framework for doing federal stock assessments could be beneficial and could provide new capabilities that would be difficult to build in older frameworks.
