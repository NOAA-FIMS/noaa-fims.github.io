# Mission

The mission of the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) is to **enhance the connection of models used to assess the status of managed fish stocks to ecosystem, climate, and socioeconomic factors while meeting current management needs.**

We aim to accomplish our mission with a **user-friendly stock assessment tool** that **streamlines** the development and application of scientific advice to inform current and future management needs of NOAA Fisheries' regions.

# Community

A team of [experts](contributors.qmd) within NOAA Fisheries is designing and developing the system, and we are advised by the [FIMS Council](contributors.qmd#fims-council) which includes academic, industry, and international partners.

Contributions from individuals of all skill levels are welcome. The codebase and documentation heavily relies of contributions from volunteers and it is imperative that we receive both feedback and contributions from users to ensure the user experience remains true to our aim of being user friendly. The roles of internal and external collaborators are outlined in the [roles section](contributors.qmd#roles) of this community playbook. 

## Get involved <i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i>
