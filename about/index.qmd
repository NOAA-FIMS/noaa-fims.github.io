# Mission

The mission of the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) **is to enhance the connection of models used to assess the status of managed fish stocks to ecosystem, climate, and socioeconomic factors while meeting current management needs.**

👋 Hey there!


**We aim to accomplish our mission with a user-friendly stock assessment tool that streamlines the development and application of scientific advice to inform current and future management needs of NOAA Fisheries' regions.**

A team of [experts](contributors.qmd) within NOAA Fisheries is designing and developing the system, and we are advised by the FIMS Council which includes academic, industry, and international partners. The roles of internal and external collaborators are outlined in the [roles section](contributors.qmd#roles) of our community playbook. 

## Get involved

Users and developers are welcome to join the [Discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/discussions) or submit bug reports using GitHub issues. Please use the issues under [collaborative workflow](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/collaborative_workflow/issues) to make suggestions about the developer guide and the issues under the FIMS software [repository](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/issues) for software design and development feedback.
