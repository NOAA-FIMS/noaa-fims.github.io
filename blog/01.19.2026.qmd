  text: "Codecov has had some recent development that allows you to [use copilot to generate tests](https://about.codecov.io/product/feature/codecov-ai/) for your Pull Request. It uses context from your test report to generate unit tests that target exactly what is missing so you can boost patch coverage. You can add the following comment on a Pull Request to make this happen. This feature has yet to be tried yet on a NOAA-FIMS repository."
