  text: "To add ten years of projections onto your time series you can use `FIMS::FIMSFrame()` to add -999 to all of your data streams by just adding a single year of -999 for any type with the maximum year that you want to project to. See the code below for an example, which was taken from the [projections vignette](https://noaa-fims.github.io/FIMS/articles/fims-demo-projections.html). Now we need to think carefully about the default uncertainty values for the -999 in each type."

::: {#announcements}
- Meg and Ian will be doing a [training next week](https://meet.google.com/unsupported?meetingCode=yhu-xrvw-yqn&ref=https://meet.google.com/yhu-xrvw-yqn) on [FIMSdiags](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMSdiags).
- Please encourage your peers to use the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/discussions) to ask questions about FIMS and propose features so we can talk about them in a public forum.
- If you attended the FIMS Training on Monday, please fill out the survey on [Google Cloud Workstations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehj6N1ka568ohEsakRQZbHxrduf1EswkYbVavhPXYBuruM7A/viewform).
