# If there is no code club or seaside chat, just delete those lines and the template will handle it for you

# If there is no actual photo you can delete include-photo, path, and alt-text

  text: "We are using copilot to help with some changes related to integers in C++ in [[PR #1199](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/pull/1199)] to remove many of the compiler warnings when you compile on a Windows machine. These warnings are helpful when developing and this effort will make it even more helpful because you will not have to sift through hundreds of non-helpful warnings to get to the ones that you want."
