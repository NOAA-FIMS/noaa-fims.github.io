  bt1: "As the year winds down and everyone enjoys their holiday season the development pace of FIMS will be slightly slower over this week and the following week. Please take time to enjoy your friends and family."
  bt2: "We are working on a hot-fix release to 0.7.0 that fixes a few 🐛🐛. At the last Code Club we prioritized closing all 🐛 issues and this will stay a priority until it is finished."
  bt3: "Bai is working on a Pull Request to establish a bash script to set up FIMS, which will be helpful for Google Cloud workstations. It has also been helpful to test out the install process on several different types of machines. Feel free to give feedback here on [FIMS Discussion 1073](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/discussions/1073)."
# Announcements go below because of formatting that quarto doesnt transfer over from the yml
# If there is no code club or seaside chat, just delete those lines and the template will handle it for you
upcoming-events:
# If you have any additional events, uncomment and fill out the additional events section below.
# If there is no actual photo you can delete include-photo, path, and alt-text 
# and the template will handle it for you. 
# If there is code instead, please uncomment the section below named photo-code 
# but still include the text portion under photo.

  text: "`x %notin% table` is currently in the development version of [R](https://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS/2025/12/05) and is an idiom for `!(x %in% table)` and provided almost entirely for convenience and code readability, from an R-devel suggestion, after many years of private definitions mostly hidden in packages, including in R's {tools}."
