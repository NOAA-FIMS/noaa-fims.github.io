  text: "When you are installing packages in R there are several ways to go about doing this but we recommend using [{pak}](https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/features.html) because it is one of the few methods that automatically installs packages in parallel, which can considerably speed up the process. You can set up `install.packages()` to use parallel methods but it will not be able to optimize things based on the mutual dependencies found across a set of packages that you wish to install, like {pak} can."
