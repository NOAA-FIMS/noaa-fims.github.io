  text: "Thanks to my GitHub Project Board mentors, Andrea and Kathryn, I have revitalized the [Issue Triage Board](https://github.com/orgs/NOAA-FIMS/projects/21) and I will be working on getting the, currently, 104 un-triaged issues assigned to someone or placed in the parking lot. It took me a while but I think Project Boards might be growing on me."

::: {#announcements}
- The CIE Review will be November 04--06, 2025 and **all** materials must be delivered to the reviewers four weeks prior to this, i.e., October 07, 2025.
- Much of the collaborative workflow guide has been moved to this website and to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Three files are left to migrate, the model specifications, hpp templates, and testing information. The testing information will move to Bai's new test README.md file.
