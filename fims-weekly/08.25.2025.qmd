  text: "I recently learned about [Deep Wiki](www.deepwiki.com) where you can view a Wiki about any repository that is available on GitHub. I looked to see what Deep Wiki had to say about FIMS and first found it was not indexed but all it took to change that was proving my email. Within minutes, [FIMS had its own page](https://deepwiki.com/NOAA-FIMS/FIMS). Several diagrams were generated but the one that I thought was the most helpful (see below) summarized what is available in the main branch for the C++ code. I think this image will be extremely helpful as FIMS becomes more complex. I just wish I knew how we can create it dynamically ☹️"
