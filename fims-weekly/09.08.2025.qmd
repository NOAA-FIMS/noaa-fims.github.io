#' Covert the dimension information from a FIMS json output into a tibble
#'
#' Dimensions in the json output are stored as a list of length two, with the
#' header information containing the name of the dimension and the dimensions
#' containing integers specifying the length for each dimension. The result
#' helps interpret how the FIMS output is structured given it is dimension
#' folded into a single vector in the json output.
#'
#' @param data A list containing the header and dimensions information from a
#'   FIMS json output object.
#' @return
#' A tibble containing ordered rows for each combination of the dimensions.
#' @examples
#' dummy_dimensions <- list(
#'   header = list("nyears", "nages"),
#'   dimensions = list(30L, 12L)
#' )
#' dimensions_to_tibble(dummy_dimensions)
dimensions_to_tibble <- function(data) {
  # Create names that are informative for columns b/c nyears is not helpful
  better_names <- unlist(data[["header"]]) |>
    gsub(pattern = "^n(.+)s$", replacement = "\\1_ids")
  names(data[["dimensions"]]) <- better_names
  # Create the returned tibble by first sequencing from 1:n for each dimension
