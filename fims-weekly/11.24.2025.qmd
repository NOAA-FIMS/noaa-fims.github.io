three-big-things:
  bt1: "This week's Code Club will be our first installment of a 3-hour time window for coding. You can think of this as a monthly hackathon now instead of our weekly sessions. We will work on (1) reviewing the outstanding Pull Requests to dev, (2) writing a log statement for the newest version that is about to be released, and (3) updating the cheat sheet given the changes to the R interface. Breakout rooms will allow you to work on things in a quiet space or in small groups if desired."
  bt2: "With the shortened week because of the holiday, I am not certain we will be able to get a release out but we will at least work towards that goal."
  bt3: "Now that the ICES Methods Group Working Group is over, we will resume forward progress on the Surplus Production Model, which will be our second release from now."

  text: "A few months ago, Posit introduced [Databot](https://posit.co/blog/introducing-databot/) to help explore your data. This is not really of direct interest to FIMS but I think the concept is. Our figures and tables should with a FIMS data object should be relatively similar where we build a command such as `summarize()` to give similar summaries."
