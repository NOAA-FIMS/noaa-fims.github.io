#' Create a Quarto Weekly Newsletter Template File
#'
#' Generates a Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) file for a weekly newsletter, 
#' pre-populated with YAML front matter including title, date, categories, 
#' events, and other structured sections. The week range in the title is 
#' automatically determined based on the provided start date and optionally an 
#' end date. The resulting file is created in the `fims-weekly` directory.
#'
#' @param date The start date of the week (as a `Date` object or character 
#' string, default is today if `NULL`).
#' @param week_end_date Optional end date of the week (as a `Date` object or 
#' character string). If not provided, the week will end on the next Friday 
#' after \code{date}.
#' @param file_name Optional file name for the newsletter file. If `NULL`, 
#' the file will be named as `"mm.dd.yyyy.qmd"` using the start date.
#'
#' @details
#' The function automatically formats the week range in the title, showing both 
#' months if the week spans two different months. The file is saved in the `fims-weekly` directory (relative to your project root, using `here::here()`). The newsletter template includes placeholder fields for categories, big things, events, and photo caption.
#'
#' @return (Invisibly) the full path of the created `.qmd` file.
